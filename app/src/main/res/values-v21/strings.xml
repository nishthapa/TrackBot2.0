    <string name="App_Description_about">
   "    This is a Joystick Enabled Controller
    for a Robot which can be used over
    Bluetooth and WiFi.

    It Features 3 Controller modes  :

    Analog Joystick :-
    Your Bot can be controlled with an Anolog
    JoyStickon the Screen like a Video Game
    Controller.

    Buttons :-
    Directional Buttons such as Forward,
    Backward, Left, Right and an Emergency
    Stop Make basic navigation very easy.

    Motion Sensor :-
    Your phone takes realtime readings
    from the Motion Sensors (Gyroscope,
    Accelerometer and Magnetometer)
    to map the Current Orintation of
    the phone in 3D Space, processes
    it and sends that data via the
    connection which your Bot can then
    use for navigation.

    It also features a simple Login mechanism
    which can keep all the settings intact for
    each user so that you dont have to
    configure everything from the ground up
    next time you use this app.

    Just make sure to Add a new user from the
    menu the first time you install and run this
    app.


    Keep experimenting, learning and have fun.
